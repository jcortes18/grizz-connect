# CSI4999: Grizz Connect 

This project was designed as an Oakland University specific ecommerce application. As a university student we need to buy books and equipment for a reasonable price and the best way is to buy from other students. Our application also incorporates health and safety parameters where it notifies user of potencial help centers across university e.g(GHC). We have designed it with goal of cloud deployment so the backend completely runs in GCP and front end can be integrated in Firebase very quickly.
